Our plan is to make dataset and to label it we will apply to every image cv2 and mediapipe methods
 to crop needable area(only skin of face(may be with beard or other hair)).
 
 We have to separate it on 2 classes - healthy/unhealthy
 Classification tree:
                    image
                      /\
                     /  \
                ----+    +----                                  YOLOv8 classification model(2 classes)          *
                |             |
                |             |
             healthy      unhealthy
                              |
                --------------|--------------                   YOLOv8 classification model(number of diseases) **
                |             |              |
                THERE WILL BE TYPES OF DISEASE
                                                                3 YOLOv8 classification model(3 groups yet)      ***
                EVERY TYPE WILL be classified 
                on three group of neglet stages(20%, 75%, 90%)
                (It could be more groups whether we'll have 
                enough data to classify it more precisely )

If * returns healthy ----> 0% of diseases
Else give image to **.
** returns type of disease and 

 After it train YOLOv8 on this dataset and receive .pt model.
 Futher we will use this model on 25 frames from video stream every time when model will be ready for next set of images.
 Every frame will be cropped as in our training dataset.

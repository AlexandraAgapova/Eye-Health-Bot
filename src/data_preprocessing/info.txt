    |       |----<image_name>.jpg
    |       |----<image_name>.jpg
    |       ...
    |
    |----healthy_rem/
    |       |----<image_name>.jpg
    |       |----<image_name>.jpg
    |       |----<image_name>.jpg

            |----<image_name>.jpg
            |----<image_name>.jpg
            |----<image_name>.jpg
            |...

sorting --- directory with sorting.py
to_sort --- directory with images you want to sort
trash --- directory with trash images after running script
healthy_rem and unhealthy --- directories with healthy faces and unhealthy respectively 

when you type ```python sorting.py``` you will see window with current image you sorting right now
There are some keys you can use:
    h - move image to healthy_rem
    u - move image to unhealthy
    q - quit the program
    t - move image to trash

if you type any other key you will skip picture. Sorry thats just for a while.
